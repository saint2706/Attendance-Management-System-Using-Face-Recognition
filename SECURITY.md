## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Instead, please report security issues by opening a [private security advisory](https://github.com/saint2706/Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.
3. Alternatively, contact the maintainers directly through the repository.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### Response Timeline

- We aim to acknowledge security reports within 48 hours.
- We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days.
- We will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly.

### Disclosure Policy

- We request that you give us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.
- We will credit researchers who report valid vulnerabilities (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
