# Documentation Archive

This directory contains the previous versions of documentation that were archived on **2025-12-22** during a comprehensive documentation revamp.

## Why These Files Were Archived

The entire documentation set underwent a ground-up rewrite to:

1. **Ensure accuracy**: Align all documentation with the current codebase (v1.7.0)
2. **Improve navigation**: Create clear, audience-specific documentation paths
3. **Modernize content**: Update tone, structure, and examples for better clarity
4. **Remove duplication**: Consolidate overlapping content
5. **Fix broken references**: Update all internal links and commands

## What Was Archived

All documentation files as of commit `fa7064a` (December 22, 2025) including:

- Root-level documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- All docs/* files (30+ documentation files)
- Frontend and test documentation
- GitHub workflow documentation
- Agent instruction files

## Finding Current Documentation

The new documentation structure is organized by audience:

- **Quick Start**: See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md)
- **User Guide**: See [docs/USER_GUIDE.md](../USER_GUIDE.md)
- **Developer Guide**: See [docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
- **Full Index**: See [docs/DOCS_INDEX.md](../DOCS_INDEX.md)
- **Main README**: See [README.md](../../README.md)

## Archive Contents

All files in this directory maintain their original directory structure for easy reference:

```
_archive/
├── root/          # Root-level .md files

├── frontend/      # Frontend documentation
├── tests/         # Test documentation
└── github/        # GitHub-specific docs
```

## Historical Context

These archived files represent the state of the documentation from the project's inception through version 1.6.0. They contain valuable historical context but may reference:

- Outdated commands or workflows
- Removed or renamed features
- Old directory structures
- Broken internal links

## Attribution

All archived documentation was created by the original contributors and maintainers of the Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition project. Credit remains with the original authors.
