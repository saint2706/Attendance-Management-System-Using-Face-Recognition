## What is the Smart Attendance System?

The Smart Attendance System uses face recognition technology to automatically track when employees arrive at and leave work. Instead of manually signing in or using punch cards, employees simply look at a camera, and the system recognizes them and records their attendance.

### Key Benefits
- **Fast**: Takes only seconds to mark attendance
- **Accurate**: Uses AI to correctly identify employees
- **Secure**: Your face data is protected and encrypted
- **Automatic**: No manual record-keeping needed

## Getting Started

### First Time Access

When you first use the system, your administrator will:
1. Create an account for you
2. Take photos of your face
3. Give you your username and password

### Accessing the System

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. Go to the system's web address (your IT department will provide this)
3. You'll see the home page with three options:
   - **Mark Time-In**: Use this when you arrive at work
   - **Mark Time-Out**: Use this when you're leaving for the day
   - **Dashboard Login**: Use this to view your records or manage the system (if you're an admin)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my face data safe?**
A: Yes! All facial data is encrypted and stored securely. It's only used for attendance purposes and follows data privacy regulations.

**Q: Can I mark attendance from home?**
A: That depends on your organization's policy. The system works wherever there's internet access, but your admin may restrict remote access.

**Q: What if I forget to mark time-out?**
A: Contact your administrator. They can view and adjust your records if needed.

**Q: Can I use the system on my phone?**
A: Yes! The system works on any device with a camera and web browser, including smartphones and tablets.

### For Employees

**Q: How often do I need to update my photos?**
A: Generally, photos don't need updating unless your appearance changes significantly (major haircut, facial hair, weight change, etc.). Ask your admin if you need new photos.

**Q: What happens if the camera doesn't recognize me?**
A: Try again with better lighting. If it still doesn't work after a few attempts, contact your administrator.

**Q: Can I see other employees' attendance?**
A: No, regular employees can only see their own records. Only administrators can view all records.

**Q: How do I change my password?**
A: Contact your administrator to reset your password.

### For Administrators

A: The system automatically captures multiple photos (typically 50-100) from different angles to improve accuracy.

**Q: Do I need to manually train the system after adding photos?**
A: No! The system automatically trains itself when new photos are added. You'll see a message confirming this.

**Q: Can I delete an employee?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to access the admin panel (contact your IT department for details on employee management).

**Q: How do I generate monthly reports?**
A: Use the "View by Employee" or "View by Date" features, select the date range, and export to CSV. You can then analyze the data in Excel.

**Q: What if two employees look similar?**
A: The system is very accurate and can distinguish between similar-looking people. However, if there's confusion, you can retake photos with better lighting and angles.
