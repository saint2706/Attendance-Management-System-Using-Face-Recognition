# User Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the Smart Attendance System, designed for non-technical users. It covers everything from logging in to interpreting attendance reports.

## 1. Core Concepts

- **Face Recognition:** The system uses a webcam to identify employees by their unique facial features. Each face is converted into a secure digital signature (an "embedding"). When an employee clocks in or out, the system compares the new embedding to the stored ones to find a match.
- **Attendance Record:** A timestamped entry that confirms when an employee has checked in or out.
- **Dashboard:** The main screen after logging in, providing access to all features. Admins and employees see different dashboards tailored to their roles.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Logging In

2.  Click on the **Dashboard Login** button.
3.  Enter your username and password.
4.  Click **Login**.

### For Employees

#### Adding Employee Photos

1.  From the admin dashboard, click on **Add Photos**.
2.  Enter the username of the employee and click **Add Photos**.
3.  The system will automatically capture a set of images to create a face profile for the employee. Ensure the employee is in a well-lit area and facing the camera.

#### Viewing Attendance Reports

Admins have access to several attendance reports:

- **Attendance by Date:** View a list of all employees who were present on a specific date, along with their work hours.
- **Attendance by Employee:** View the complete attendance history for a single employee over a selected date range.

## 3. Interpreting the Results

The attendance reports provide the following information:

- **Time In:** The first recorded check-in time for the day.
- **Time Out:** The last recorded check-out time for the day.
- **Hours:** The total hours worked for the day.
- **Break Hours:** The total time spent on breaks.

The system also generates graphs to help you visualize attendance trends.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Recognition Issues:** If the system is having trouble recognizing an employee, ensure they are in a well-lit area and facing the camera directly. If the problem persists, an admin may need to recapture the employee's photos.
- **Incorrect Timestamps:** If you notice any incorrect timestamps in your attendance records, please contact an administrator to have them corrected.
