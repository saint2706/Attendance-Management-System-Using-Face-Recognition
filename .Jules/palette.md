## 2024-05-23 - Context-Aware Success Actions
**Learning:** In kiosk-style flows like attendance marking, a single "Try Again" button is insufficient for success states. Users need explicit choices: "Mark Another" (for the next person) or "Return Home" (for the current person finishing up).
**Action:** When designing success states for repetitive tasks, always provide both a "Reset/Next" action and an "Exit" action to support different user flows.
